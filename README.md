## Trip card

A demo project implementing a trip card component
the implementation is focused on reproducing the design on Figma , with some responsiveness built in

### Notes

-   the styles could use some clean-up to avoid repeating some rules especially for text, by creating some global styles
-   the mock data is not necessarily the best representation of how the payload types would be ,rather it is optimized for a quick design implementation, but I left some comments to give an idea of what could be improved.

### How to run

-   install all dependencies by running `npm install`
-   run the dev server `npm run dev`
-   navigate to http://localhost:5173
