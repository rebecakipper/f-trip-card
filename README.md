## Trip card

A demo project implementing a trip card component.
The implementation is focused on reproducing the design on Figma, with some responsiveness built in.

### Notes

-   The styles could use some clean-up to avoid repeating some rules, especially for text, by creating some global styles
-   The mock data is not necessarily the best representation of the payload types, it is rather optimized for a quick design implementation. I left some comments to give an idea of what could be improved.

### How to run

-   install all dependencies by running `npm install`
-   run the dev server `npm run dev`
-   navigate to http://localhost:5173
